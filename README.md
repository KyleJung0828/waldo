## UBC CPSC 210 Project

Android app that lets you find the fastest public transit route to get to the location of another user in Metro Vancouver 

## How it works

The app queries an API to retrieve the location of other users of the app and report the location of the current user. To find a route to another user, the app queries [TransLink's Open API](https://developer.translink.ca/) to determine the fastest SkyTrain/bus route.

## TODO

- Deal with the deprecated / modified APIs
- Allow users to create accounts and add their friends (maybe connect to social media).
- The current app uses its own custom map; switch to Google Maps
